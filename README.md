## üéØ **Objectives**

### 1. **Objective 1: Problem Understanding: Fantasy Football Player Performance Analysis**

In the fantasy football ecosystem, platforms like ESPN, FantasyPros, CBS Sports, Sleeper, and Yahoo provide player performance predictions that users rely on to make decisions. However, these platforms often have slight variations in predictions for the same player, leading to uncertainty for fantasy football participants who want to optimize their lineups. Understanding the accuracy of these predictions compared to actual player performance can help users make better-informed decisions, but there are several challenges to overcome.

#### **Problem Breakdown**:

1. **Inconsistent Player Name Representation**:
   - Each platform may represent player names differently (e.g., "Patrick Mahomes" vs. "P. Mahomes"), use abbreviations, or include variations due to suffixes (e.g., "Jr."). These inconsistencies make direct comparisons difficult, leading to inaccurate or missed data mappings.
   - A solution is needed to standardize or reconcile player names across platforms to ensure accurate matching and data consistency.

2. **Varying Prediction Methodologies**:
   - Each fantasy platform uses its own algorithm to predict player performance, leading to differing score projections for the same player. Without a clear way to track the accuracy of these projections, it becomes challenging for users to know which platform to trust more.
   - A comparison of actual scores with these projections would give users valuable insights into how closely each platform‚Äôs predictions align with reality.

3. **Metadata Discrepancies**:
   - In addition to name discrepancies, platforms may present players with varying metadata such as team names or positions. This can further complicate the identification of players across platforms, especially in cases where a player changes teams or where positions are inconsistently labeled.
   - Incorporating metadata (like team and position) into the player matching process will improve the reliability of cross-platform player identification.

4. **Difficulty in Automating Data Collection**:
   - Accessing player performance data (both predicted and actual) across multiple platforms may require different methods, such as APIs or web scraping, which vary in complexity and accessibility. Some platforms might have rate limits, restricted access, or other barriers to automated data collection.
   - An automated and efficient method for gathering data from these diverse sources is necessary to ensure up-to-date and comprehensive comparisons.

5. **Manual Comparisons**:
   - Currently, fantasy football users who want to compare platform predictions to actual results must do so manually. This is time-consuming and prone to error, especially as fantasy seasons progress and the number of players and weekly matchups increases.
   - Developing an automated tool that handles this comparison will save time, reduce errors, and allow for large-scale analysis across multiple platforms and players.

#### **Impact of the Problem**:

- **Uncertainty in Decision-Making**: Fantasy football users are left unsure about which platform‚Äôs predictions are most reliable, resulting in suboptimal lineup decisions and, potentially, lost league standings.
- **Missed Opportunities for Strategic Advantage**: Without the ability to identify consistently accurate platforms, users miss out on valuable insights that could give them a competitive edge in their leagues.
- **Increased Complexity**: The need for manual workarounds to track performance data is time-consuming and overwhelming, especially as player data grows week by week.

#### **Solution Focus**:

The core problem is the lack of an automated, standardized way to compare actual player performance against the predictions made by multiple fantasy football platforms. This project aims to address that by creating a system that:
- Standardizes player names across platforms.
- Leverages metadata to improve matching accuracy.
- Automates the collection and comparison of predicted versus actual scores.
- Provides actionable insights into which platforms offer the most reliable predictions.

This solution will simplify the process of analyzing fantasy football performance, giving users the confidence to make data-driven decisions and improve their chances of success in their leagues.
